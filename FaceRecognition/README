Train a neural network to recognize the face of the students in the class. You may retrain the neural network that you used in the previous assignment or use a different neural network for this assignment.
Notes: 
You must retrain your neural network. In other words "Do not use the neural network as a black box".
If the output of your neural network is an embedding then you may use an SVM or any other classifier after the neural network for recognizing the faces. 
You system must operate in two different modes.
Read the input images from a test directory and display each test image side by side with a representative image from the recognized person.
Capture the image from a camera and continuously display the captured image side by side with a representative image from the recognized person. 
In both modes of operations there should be a bounding box around the detected face in the test image or captured image.
